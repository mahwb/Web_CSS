            <h1>JavaScript Basics</h1>
            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. Javascript is extremely popular for a varitey
                of reasons. Is is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developter to take it
                in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a hose encironment (a web browser or Node server),
                it can ve connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#">Variable Declaration</a> Javascript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine
                    a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables
                    must be indentified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="purple">var x;</span></li>
                <li><a href="#">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to Javascript variables - our cup
                    can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variaable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns
                    a value to a variable. <span class="purple">var x = 10;</span></li>
                <li><a href="#">Data Type</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need
                    to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span class="purple">true</span> 
                    or <span class="purple">false;</span> null - <span class="purple">null</span> aka nothing; Number -
                    <span class="purple">42</span> or <span class="purple">3.14159;</span> String - <span class="purple">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> 
                    Array - <span class="purple">[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span class="purple">{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span></li>
                <li><a href="#">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions
                    - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional
                    staements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span class="purple">if</span> 
                    a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="purple">else if</span> to
                    specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span class="purple">else</span> we
                    execute this block of code;</li>
                <li><a href="#">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming langage, but they all
                    aessentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to
                    run a mile, well ou run around the track four times nd then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
                <li><a href="#">Functions</a> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our fucntion this
                    will run the code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting
                    together a desk form Ikea, we open up the instruciton manual and get started, first we screw the legs
                    to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly
                    there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
